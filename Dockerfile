# Coolify runs its health check with curl INSIDE the container, and the JRE image ships neither

#
# fontconfig and a font are for the share card: it is drawn with Java2D, which needs real fonts
# on disk. The JRE image ships none, and without them every glyph renders as a box rather than
# failing loudly — so it would only surface when someone looked at a link preview.

# and is given numerically to USER, so a runtime can tell it is not root without reading
# /etc/passwd. The unpacked jars stay root-owned and read-only to it; the only place the app writes
# is java.io.tmpdir (/tmp, world-writable), where Tomcat keeps its work directory. The home
